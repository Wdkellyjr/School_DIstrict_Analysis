# School_District_Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of the challenge is to assist a school system Chief Data Scientist, Maria, with preparing all standardized test data for analysis, reporting and presentation, to provide insights about performance trends and patterns. The information gathered will be used to form discussions and strategic planning at the school and district level. Maria asked I could help with analyzing data on student funding and student’s standardized test scores. The analysis will help the school board and superintendent in making decisions regarding the school budget and other priorities.

## Results

### School and District

•	A review of the district summary analyzed data before the tampered data was removed shows that 75% of the students are passing math and 86% are passing reading.     After the tampered data was removed, 74.8% of the students are passing math and 85.7% are passing reading. There isn’t a major difference between the two sets of   data, from reviewing the data, Maria could suggest that more funds should be allocated towards the math department to increase the passing score.
